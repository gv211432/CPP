Approach 1: Elementary Math

Intuition

Keep track of the carry using a variable and simulate digits-by-digits sum starting from the head of list, which contains the least-significant digit.

Illustration of Adding two numbers

Figure 1. Visualization of the addition of two numbers: 342+465=807342 + 465 = 807342+465=807.
Each node contains a single digit and the digits are stored in reverse order.

Algorithm

Just like how you would sum two numbers on a piece of paper, we begin by summing the least-significant digits, which is the head of l1l1l1 and l2l2l2. Since each digit is in the range of 0…90 \ldots 90…9, summing two digits may "overflow". For example 5+7=125 + 7 = 125+7=12. In this case, we set the current digit to 222 and bring over the carry=1carry = 1carry=1 to the next iteration. carrycarrycarry must be either 000 or 111 because the largest possible sum of two digits (including the carry) is 9+9+1=199 + 9 + 1 = 199+9+1=19.

The pseudocode is as following:

    Initialize current node to dummy head of the returning list.
    Initialize carry to 000.
    Initialize ppp and qqq to head of l1l1l1 and l2l2l2 respectively.
    Loop through lists l1l1l1 and l2l2l2 until you reach both ends.
        Set xxx to node ppp's value. If ppp has reached the end of l1l1l1, set to 000.
        Set yyy to node qqq's value. If qqq has reached the end of l2l2l2, set to 000.
        Set sum=x+y+carrysum = x + y + carrysum=x+y+carry.
        Update carry=sum/10carry = sum / 10carry=sum/10.
        Create a new node with the digit value of (sum mod 10)(sum \bmod 10)(summod10) and set it to current node's next, then advance current node to next.
        Advance both ppp and qqq.
    Check if carry=1carry = 1carry=1, if so append a new node with digit 111 to the returning list.
    Return dummy head's next node.

Note that we use a dummy head to simplify the code. Without a dummy head, you would have to write extra conditional statements to initialize the head's value.

Take extra caution of the following cases:
Test case Explanation
l1=[0,1]l1=[0,1]l1=[0,1]
l2=[0,1,2]l2=[0,1,2]l2=[0,1,2] When one list is longer than the other.
l1=[]l1=[]l1=[]
l2=[0,1]l2=[0,1]l2=[0,1] When one list is null, which means an empty list.
l1=[9,9]l1=[9,9]l1=[9,9]
l2=[1]l2=[1]l2=[1] The sum could have an extra carry of one at the end, which is easy to forget.

JAVA:Implementation

<!-- ===================================================================== -->

public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
ListNode dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
ListNode p = l1, q = l2, curr = dummyHead;
int carry = 0;
while (p != null || q != null) {
int x = (p != null) ? p.val : 0;
int y = (q != null) ? q.val : 0;
int sum = carry + x + y;
carry = sum / 10;
curr.next = new ListNode(sum % 10);
curr = curr.next;
if (p != null) p = p.next;
if (q != null) q = q.next;
}
if (carry > 0) {
curr.next = new ListNode(carry);
}
return dummyHead.next;
}

Complexity Analysis

    Time complexity : O(max⁡(m,n))O(\max(m, n))O(max(m,n)). Assume that mmm and nnn represents the length of l1l1l1 and l2l2l2 respectively, the algorithm above iterates at most max⁡(m,n)\max(m, n)max(m,n) times.

    Space complexity : O(max⁡(m,n))O(\max(m, n))O(max(m,n)). The length of the new list is at most max⁡(m,n)+1\max(m,n) + 1max(m,n)+1.

Follow up

What if the the digits in the linked list are stored in non-reversed order? For example:

(3→4→2)+(4→6→5)=8→0→7 (3 \to 4 \to 2) + (4 \to 6 \to 5) = 8 \to 0 \to 7 (3→4→2)+(4→6→5)=8→0→7
